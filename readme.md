## Lock User

This package uses [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)'s own authentication system to set a [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) based timer and view.
You just add the Blade directive to your app's view, set the time in minutes and it's ready to go.
